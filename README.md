## Agentic RAG Chatbot
### Stack:
- Framework: LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith
- LLM: llama3.1:8B and qwen2.5:32b via Ollama
- Vector Store: Chroma
- UI: Streamlit
- Memory: SQLite
- Embeddings: bge-small-en or all-MiniLM-L6-v2

## Approach
Development will iterate through:
1. LLM
2. Persistence (chat history/memory)
3. Vector Store (retrieval)
4. UI

## Set up
1. Use a virtual environment
2. Install requirements.txt
3. Create `.env` file similar to `.env-example` file
4. Use the correct kernal for each notebook (Python 3.12 is ideal)
